# Office Ecommerce Website

A simple e-commerce website I built using ASP.NET core MVC and bootstrap that has office products. It contains all the features that one would typically expect of a small e-commerce company. This project was great to improve my skills using ASP.NET with bootstrap.

# Demo

Here is the home page for the website.

# How To Use

- Clone the project into visual studio. 
- Open the Package Manager Console and run Update-Database. This loads the database with some seed data.
- After that, the website is all ready to use.
- To access the admin account, the username is "admin" and the password is "password"

# Features

* Full login/registrations system.
* Products page with filtering by category, sorting by header name, and products that link to a detailed product page.
* Admin system to add new products, users, search for products, edit products, delete users, and manage user roles.
* Cart system to add and remove products to purchase. Checkout is not fully implemented using a third party site since this is not a real e-commerce site.
